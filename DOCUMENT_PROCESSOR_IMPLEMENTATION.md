# 📄 Document Processor Implementation Guide

## ✅ Phase 1: Client-Side Processing - COMPLETED

Successfully implemented client-side document processing with support for PDF, Word (.docx), and text files.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Document Processor Utility** (`src/utils/documentProcessor.ts`)

A comprehensive TypeScript class that handles:
- ✅ PDF extraction using `pdfjs-dist`
- ✅ Word document (.docx) extraction using `mammoth`
- ✅ Plain text file reading
- ✅ Semantic chunking with overlap
- ✅ File validation (size, type)
- ✅ Metadata extraction (word count, character count, etc.)

### 2. **Enhanced Dashboard Upload** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)

Updated file upload functionality:
- ✅ Validates files before processing
- ✅ Extracts text from PDF/Word/Text files
- ✅ Creates semantic chunks for better AI processing
- ✅ Stores chunks and metadata in database
- ✅ Fallback handling for unsupported files
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

### 3. **Updated Database Types** (`src/types/database.ts`)

Extended Document type to include:
- `semantic_chunks`: Array of content chunks
- `processed_content`: Metadata object with word count, character count, etc.
- `knowledge_graph`: Placeholder for future enhancement

---

## 📦 Installed Packages

```bash
npm install mammoth pdfjs-dist
```

**Libraries:**
- **mammoth** (v1.8.x): Extracts text from Word documents (.docx)
- **pdfjs-dist** (v5.4.296): Mozilla's PDF.js for PDF text extraction

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### File Upload Flow

```
1. User selects file
   ↓
2. Validate file (size < 50MB, supported type)
   ↓
3. Upload to Supabase Storage
   ↓
4. Extract text using DocumentProcessor
   ↓
5. Create semantic chunks (1000 chars, 100 char overlap)
   ↓
6. Save to database with chunks & metadata
   ↓
7. Process with Gemini AI (quiz, flashcards)
   ↓
8. Set as current document
```

### Supported File Types

| File Type | Extension | Library Used | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | pdfjs-dist | ✅ Working |
| Word | `.docx` | mammoth | ✅ Working |
| Text | `.txt`, `.md` | Native File API | ✅ Working |

---

## 💾 Database Schema Updates

The `documents` table now stores additional fields:

```typescript
{
  semantic_chunks: string[];  // Array of content chunks
  processed_content: {
    word_count: number;
    character_count: number;
    chunk_count: number;
    extraction_method: string;  // 'pdf-parse', 'mammoth', or 'text'
  };
  knowledge_graph: any;  // Reserved for future use
}
```

**Note:** You may need to update your Supabase table schema to include these JSONB fields.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### PDF.js Worker Setup

The PDF.js library requires a worker file for processing. We've configured it to use a local copy:

**Location:** `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs`

**Configuration in code:**
```typescript
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.mjs';
```

**To update worker file when upgrading pdfjs-dist:**
```bash
Copy-Item "node_modules\pdfjs-dist\build\pdf.worker.min.mjs" -Destination "public\pdf.worker.min.mjs"
```

---

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Document Processing

```typescript
import { DocumentProcessor } from '@/utils/documentProcessor';

// Validate file
const validation = DocumentProcessor.validateFile(file, 50);
if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error(validation.error);
  return;
}

// Process document
const processed = await DocumentProcessor.processDocument(file);

console.log(`Extracted ${processed.metadata.wordCount} words`);
console.log(`Created ${processed.metadata.chunkCount} chunks`);
```

### Extract Text Only

```typescript
const text = await DocumentProcessor.extractText(file);
console.log(text);
```

### Custom Chunking

```typescript
const chunks = DocumentProcessor.chunkContent(
  content,
  1500,  // chunk size
  200    // overlap
);
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before Implementation
- ❌ Only `.txt` files could be processed
- ❌ PDF and Word documents showed as "binary files"
- ❌ No text extraction from uploaded documents
- ❌ Limited AI capabilities for non-text files

### After Implementation
- ✅ PDF files are automatically processed
- ✅ Word documents are automatically processed
- ✅ Full text extraction with metadata
- ✅ Semantic chunking for better AI context
- ✅ Detailed processing logs in console
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

---

## 📊 Console Output Example

When uploading a PDF file:

```
Processing 05-fullvirt.pdf (application/pdf)...
✅ Extracted 3,247 words from 05-fullvirt.pdf
📄 Created 8 semantic chunks
```

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

### Graceful Fallbacks

1. **Text Extraction Fails**
   - Falls back to filename-based processing
   - Still uploads file to storage
   - Shows clear error message to user

2. **Unsupported File Types**
   - Validates before processing
   - Shows supported formats message
   - Prevents unnecessary uploads

3. **AI Processing Fails**
   - Document is still saved
   - User can retry later
   - Error logged to console

### Example Error Messages

```typescript
// File too large
"File size (52.3MB) exceeds maximum of 50MB"

// Unsupported type
"Unsupported file type. Supported formats: PDF, Word (.docx), Text (.txt, .md)"

// Empty document
"No text content extracted from PDF (might be scanned/image-based)"
```

## 🔍 Semantic Chunking Algorithm

### How It Works

1. **Split by Sentences:** Content is split at sentence boundaries (`.`, `!`, `?`)
2. **Build Chunks:** Sentences are concatenated until chunk size is reached
3. **Add Overlap:** Last portion of previous chunk overlaps with next chunk
4. **Preserve Context:** Overlap ensures context continuity for AI

### Configuration

```typescript
chunkContent(
  content: string,
  chunkSize: number = 1000,    // Max characters per chunk
  overlap: number = 100         // Characters to overlap
): string[]
```

### Why Chunking?

- **AI Token Limits:** Large documents exceed AI model context windows
- **Better Context:** Smaller chunks provide focused context
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple chunks can be processed simultaneously
- **Improved Relevance:** AI can find specific information faster

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2 - Future Enhancement)

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Users
1. Use text-based PDFs (not scanned images)
2. Keep files under 50MB for best performance
3. Wait for processing to complete before navigating away
4. Check console for detailed processing logs

### For Developers
1. Always validate files before processing
2. Use try-catch blocks around extraction logic
3. Provide fallback content for unsupported formats
4. Log extraction metadata for debugging
5. Test with various document types
