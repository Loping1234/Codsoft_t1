The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It generates energy through cellular respiration. The process of cellular respiration involves three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.

Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and converts light energy to chemical energy. This process involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

Cell division is essential for growth and repair. There are two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis produces identical diploid cells, while meiosis produces genetically diverse gametes.

DNA is the genetic material that contains instructions for all cellular processes. It consists of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. These bases pair specifically: A with T, and G with C.

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are highly specific and can be affected by factors such as temperature, pH, and substrate concentration.

The cell membrane controls what enters and exits the cell. It is selectively permeable and maintains homeostasis within the cell. Transport across the membrane can be active or passive.
